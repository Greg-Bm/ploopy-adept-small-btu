A small Ploopy Adept case with BTU bearings

I really like the Ploopy Adept hardware, but I wanted something smaller and lower to use between the two parts of my split keyboard. So I created this case for the Ploopy Adept, which is pretty small and low.

There are 3 versions:

- [V1](./v1-deprecated/): for a 34mm trackball. This is the initial version and it is deprecated. I would not recommend going for it. I am just keeping it here in case anyone still needs it. It will go at some point.

- [V2](./v2/): for a 38.1mm (1.5 inch) trackball. This version is still good to use and it can also fit the 34mm trackball support from V3.

- [V3](./v3/): which has trackball supports for both 34mm and 38.1mm trackballs. It is somewhat the same as V2, but with aesthetical improvements and slight improvements on the buttons too. In V3, the top and bottom of the case are the same, whether you choose to use a 34mm or a 38.1mm trackball, but you need to choose the correct track ball support.

I would obviously recommend going for the V3, but it is up to you to choose. You can find assembly instructions by browsing into the folder of each the versions.

Enjoy it! Feedback and contributions are very welcome :).
